Resetting and rebuilding styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Eric Meyer https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html
along with Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/

All sizing (typography, layout, padding/margins, etc) are inspired by a modular scale that uses 1em as a base size with a 1.618 ratio.
